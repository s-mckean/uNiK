# uNiK iNC Tanks
Final Project for uNiK iNC

Designed to be played at a resolution of 1024x768.

A fast-paced multiplayer artillery-style game with multiple flashy projectiles and destructible tetris-themed environment.  

Move your tank left and right with A and D and use your thrusters to boost yourself to higher elevations with the SPACEBAR.

Use your MOUSE to set the trajectory of your projectile, then hold down MOUSE1 to charge up the power of your shot.  
Release MOUSE1 to shoot your shot and watch your projectile obliterate the poor victim in its path.

Open the weapon select menu with the e key.

Keep damaging your opponents with your projectiles until their health reaches 0 or they fall into the white blocks which kill the player that falls into them.
